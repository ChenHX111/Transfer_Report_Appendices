# Transfer Report Appendices
Appendices for Transfer Report for My Thesis "An Explainable AI Framework for Music Generation and Evaluation".  
This repository contains detailed appendices and supplementary materials for the transfer report for "An Explainable AI Framework for Music Generation and Evaluation" by Chenhao Xue. The materials provided here extend the discussion and analysis presented in the thesis, offering additional insights into the Literature Review section (Noise2Music model, music feature engineering), First Year Work section (feature extraction, visualizations), and Research Proposal section (9-months plan for proposed project 2 and project 3). Below is a guide to the appendices included in this repository.  
The PDF file of the Appendices can be found in the Release v1.0.0

# Appendix A: Personal & Professional Development
This section lists some of my personal and professional skills developed during the first year time of my DPhil.

# Appendix B: Literature Review Complements
In this section, I give further details on the related literature of my thesis. Its section B.1 "Music Generation Methods Complements Table" presents the key parameters of one music generation model, the Noise2Music. Its section B.2 "Music Feature Engineering and Representation Learning" presents the literature review of Music Feature Engineering and Representation Learning.

# Appendix C: First Year Work Complements
In this section, I give further details on my first-year work. In its section C.1 "Initial Feature Extraction and Visualization", I provided extended content on extracting and visualizing some timbral, rhythm, tonal, loudness and envelop, similarity, and audio quality features. In its section C.2 "Feature Space Exploration", I provided the larger size figures and tables that I presented in the section 3.2 "Feature Space Exploration Documentation" in the main report.

# Appendix D: Research Proposal Complements
In this section, I provide two additional sections of the 9-month plan for my proposed projects. Its section D.1 presents the 9-month plan of project 2 Feature-Based Visual Analytics for Content-Based Music Similarity Analysis. Its section D.2 presents the 9-month plan of project 3 Feature Assisted Music Generation Framework with Quality Assurance.

# Appendix E: Paper In-Progress
In this section, I give further details on composite features construction with my proposed genetic programming approach. It is also an early draft of a paper that we are working on.
